Used Storytelling approach for raise peopleâ€™s interest in climate change, greenhouse gas production and or the use of clean energy by creating carbon dioxide and population bar/line graphs, a global heat map, and a bird migration map by using D3.js and scroll.js. Scroll.js was implemented through providing different states of visualizations as different cases, and each case was animated in its transition.
